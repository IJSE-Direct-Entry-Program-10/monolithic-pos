# Monolithic POS System

Welcome to the Software Archiecture Series! This project focuses on the implementation of multiple architectural styles, including monolithic architecture, client-server architecture, resource-oriented architecture (ROA), and layered architecture (MVC2, Extended MVC or n-tier archiecture). By exploring these compound architectural approaches, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different architectural styles can be utilized to build robust and scalable software systems.
